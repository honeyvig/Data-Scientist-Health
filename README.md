# Data-Scientist-Health
The project is about organising structured and unstructured data on many clinical trials in order to produce aggregate-level insights.

This is a commercial project, yet with a mission to advance public health through better information on biomedical R&D.

You need data science skills and interest in health & science.

Medical expertise is not necessary - you can learn about the data during the project. An example task is classifying clinical trials into interventions that either have shown to extend patients’ survival, or to reduce symptoms (without proven survival benefit).

You can use any technology for this project - indeed, technology-driven automation-oriented scalable solutions are expected! You can also use this project to test and learn new technologies.

This is a creative research project: some data is found in different structured data tables, other data needs to be extracted from PDFs. You will need curiosity and a meticulous approach. The deliverables are the cleaned finalised data as well as any (documented) source code.

Upon successful completion there will likely be follow-up projects. It’s a plus if you also have experience with cloud databases and visualisations.
===================
To tackle the project you described, you’ll need to organize both structured and unstructured data, process and clean clinical trial data, and generate insights. This involves multiple steps, including extracting data from PDFs, classifying clinical trials, and presenting the results in an automated, scalable manner.

Below is a Python code outline to help you get started with the project. The code uses libraries like pandas for data processing, PyPDF2 for extracting data from PDFs, and scikit-learn for classification. Additionally, cloud database management can be handled using AWS services or a local database system like SQLite or PostgreSQL.
Steps Overview:

    Extract Data from Structured Tables: This involves parsing CSV, Excel, or SQL databases.
    Extract Data from PDFs: This requires PDF extraction using tools like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber.
    Data Cleaning: Handle missing data, remove duplicates, and standardize values.
    Classification of Clinical Trials: Use machine learning models to classify clinical trials.
    Data Aggregation and Visualization: Aggregate data for insights and visualize results.

Explanation:

    Data Extraction and Cleaning:
        Structured Data: The load_structured_data function loads structured data from CSV or Excel.
        Unstructured Data: The extract_text_from_pdf function extracts text from PDF documents. You can use regular expressions or other NLP techniques to parse and extract structured information (e.g., trial outcomes).
        Cleaning: The clean_data function drops missing values and removes duplicates, and it standardizes column names.

    Classification:
        Clinical Trial Classification: In the classify_trials function, we create a basic classification task to categorize trials based on intervention outcomes (Survival or Symptom Reduction). It uses RandomForestClassifier, but you can adjust this based on your data and needs.

    Data Aggregation and Visualization:
        Aggregation: The visualize_insights function aggregates clinical trial outcomes (e.g., counts by outcome) and visualizes them in a bar chart.

    Cloud Database:
        The save_to_cloud_database function allows you to save the final cleaned data to a cloud database, such as PostgreSQL, using SQLAlchemy.

    PDF Processing:
        The extract_trials_from_pdf function demonstrates how to extract specific trial data from PDFs, e.g., trial IDs and outcomes.

Next Steps:

    Refining the Classification Model: You can fine-tune the classification model by extracting more features and applying more advanced ML models.
    Data Aggregation: Extend the aggregation function to produce more detailed reports.
    Cloud Integration: Use AWS or other cloud services to store and query the data for scalability.

Technologies:

    Data Processing: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy
    Text Extraction: PyPDF2, re (regex), pdfplumber
    Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
    Database: SQLAlchemy, psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL), AWS RDS
